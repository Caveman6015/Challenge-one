# Challenge one HTML-Git-CSS

## Description

I was tasked with refactoring this webpage. It was operational but had several operational issues. I was able to get all the links to work and make sure accessibility standards were all met. I was also able to better structure the code to make it easier to read. Throughout my experience of fixing and compressing certain elements of the code in CSS I was able to better comprehend the individual elements and their relationship between CSS and HTML. 


## Installation

There will be a link in the usage section to navigate to the webpage.
